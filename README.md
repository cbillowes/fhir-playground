# FHIR Playground

![Example](./example.png)

See [this (about)](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/) and [this (API)](https://hapi.fhir.org/baseR4).

Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) is a healthcare data standard with an API for representing and exchanging electronic health records (EHR). FHIR is an information network that lets you link data across systems and a communication network that lets you exchange data between systems.

## Why this Project?

This project is a playground for me to learn about FHIR and to experiment with the data. I am interested in the following:

- How to represent FHIR data in Clojure
- How to query FHIR data
- How to transform FHIR data
- How to visualize FHIR data
